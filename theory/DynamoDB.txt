ðŸ”‘ Core Features of DynamoDB
1. Fully Managed and Serverless

No server provisioning or management needed.
Auto-scales for throughput and storage.
Built-in fault tolerance and high availability.
2. Key-Value and Document Data Models

Supports flexible schema-less design.
Stores data as key-value pairs or JSON-like documents.
3. High Performance at Scale

Single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
Suitable for applications needing real-time access.
4. Automatic Scaling

DynamoDB Auto Scaling adjusts read/write throughput capacity based on traffic.
Optionally supports provisioned throughput with limits.
5. Global Tables

Multi-region, active-active replication.
Enables globally distributed applications with low latency.
6. Streams (Change Data Capture)

DynamoDB Streams capture changes (insert, update, delete) to items.
Integrates with AWS Lambda to trigger functions on data change.
7. Integrated with AWS Lambda and Event-Driven Architectures

Native event source mapping for serverless event processing.
8. Fine-Grained Access Control

Uses IAM policies for table- and item-level access.
Supports encryption at rest and in transit.
9. On-Demand Backup and Restore

Create backups without affecting performance or availability.
Point-in-time recovery (PITR) allows restoring to any second within the last 35 days.
10. DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)

In-memory caching layer.
Boosts read performance by 10x (microsecond latency).
11. Secondary Indexes

Global Secondary Index (GSI): Query on non-key attributes.
Local Secondary Index (LSI): Sort key variations on the same partition key.
