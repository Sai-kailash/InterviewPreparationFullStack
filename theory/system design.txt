🔁 Forward Proxy Uses
Use Case	Description
🔒 Anonymity & Privacy	Hides the client’s IP from target servers, masking the identity/location.
🌍 Access Control	Restricts access to specific websites or IPs—commonly used in corporations or schools.
🌐 Content Filtering	Filters out unwanted or malicious content (e.g., ads, adult sites).
🚫 Bypass Geo-Restrictions	Helps users access region-locked content (e.g., U.S.-only websites).
🕵️‍♂️ Monitoring & Logging	Admins can log and monitor user traffic for auditing or security.
💾 Caching	Stores copies of frequently accessed content to improve load time & reduce bandwidth.
🧩 Network Address Translation (NAT)	Acts on behalf of multiple clients using a single public IP address.
🛡 Security Gateway	Scans outgoing requests for malware or data leaks.
🌐 Corporate Firewalls	Used in conjunction with firewall policies to filter outgoing requests.


🔁 Reverse Proxy Uses
Use Case	Description
⚖️ Load Balancing	Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to prevent overloading.
🛡 Security & Anonymity	Hides internal server details (IP, headers, etc.) from the outside world.
🔐 SSL Termination	Offloads TLS/SSL decryption from backend servers to improve performance.
🌐 Caching	Caches responses from servers to reduce latency and server load (e.g., CDN behavior).
🚦 Request Routing	Routes requests to different servers based on URL path, headers, or load conditions.
🧩 Compression	Compresses responses before sending to clients to save bandwidth.
🔁 Global Failover	Redirects traffic if a server is down—used in high availability setups.
🕵️‍♂️ Traffic Monitoring	Logs, inspects, and audits incoming traffic for metrics or security purposes.
🧱 Application Firewalling	Filters malicious requests or blocks suspicious behavior (e.g., WAF rules).
⛓ Authentication Gateway	Centralized auth for all backend services (e.g., SSO, OAuth, token validation).
