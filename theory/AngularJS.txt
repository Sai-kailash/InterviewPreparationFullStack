| **Concept**                 | **AngularJS (1.x)**                                        | **Angular (2+)**                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**                | JavaScript                                                 | TypeScript                                                                  |
| **Architecture Pattern**    | MVC (Model-View-Controller)                                | Component-based architecture                                                |
| **Modules**                 | No native module system, used `ng-app`, `ng-controller`    | Uses `@NgModule` for defining modules                                       |
| **Dependency Injection**    | Custom DI system                                           | Hierarchical DI system built-in via TypeScript decorators                   |
| **Data Binding**            | Two-way by default (`ng-model`)                            | One-way and two-way binding with `[(ngModel)]`                              |
| **Templates**               | Uses HTML with Angular-specific syntax (`ng-*` directives) | Uses HTML with `[property]`, `(event)`, `*ngFor`, `*ngIf`, etc.             |
| **Directives**              | Predefined like `ng-model`, `ng-repeat`                    | Structural (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and Attribute directives (customizable)      |
| **Scope**                   | `$scope` object used for data binding                      | No `$scope`; uses component class properties                                |
| **Controller**              | Uses `controller` for logic                                | No controller; logic is inside `@Component` class                           |
| **Watchers / Digest Cycle** | Dirty checking via `$digest()` and `$apply()`              | Uses zone.js and change detection strategy (Default or `OnPush`)            |
| **Routing**                 | `$routeProvider` via `ngRoute` module                      | `@angular/router` with route guards, lazy loading, resolvers                |
| **Forms**                   | Template-driven only                                       | Template-driven and Reactive Forms                                          |
| **Testing**                 | Jasmine + Karma setup, difficult for complex scenarios     | Easy unit and integration testing using TestBed and Jasmine/Karma           |
| **Performance**             | Slower due to watchers and digest cycle                    | Better due to Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, Ivy, ChangeDetectionStrategy |
| **Mobile Support**          | Not built with mobile in mind                              | Mobile-first and progressive web app (PWA) support                          |

| **Build & Optimization**    | Manual, uses Grunt/Gulp/Webpack                            | Integrated build optimizer, tree shaking, and bundling                      |
| **Component Communication** | Uses `$scope`, `$emit`, `$broadcast`                       | Uses `@Input()`, `@Output()`, services, RxJS                                |
| **Animations**              | `ngAnimate` module                                         | `@angular/animations` module with trigger and state transitions             |
| **HTTP Communication**      | `$http`, `$resource`                                       | `HttpClient` from `@angular/common/http`                                    |
| **State Management**        | No official solution                                       | Can use RxJS, NgRx, Akita, or services                                      |
| **Lifecycle Hooks**         | Few (e.g., `$onInit`)                                      | Rich hooks like `ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, `ngAfterViewInit`, etc.          |
| **Release Support**         | Deprecated (EOL in 2022)                                   | Actively maintained and updated regularly (LTS versions available)          |
